eFuse (electronic fuse) is a type of hardware fuse embedded inside the CPU. It is a special storage structure made up of circuits that can permanently change state. When an eFuse is "blown" (or fused), certain connections or bits in the circuit are irreversibly altered, leading to a permanent hardware state change.
More details:

    Location and Function: eFuses are typically located inside the CPU or SoC (System on Chip) and are used to store important system configurations, such as encryption keys, hardware unique identifiers (UIDs), bootloader lock status, and more.

    How it works: eFuses work by using a pulse of high voltage or current to physically alter specific circuits. Once a fuse is blown, the state of the corresponding bits is permanently changed, and they cannot be restored to their original state. This irreversible property ensures critical control over hardware features, such as locking the bootloader or disabling debugging interfaces.

    Use cases:
        System security: eFuses store unmodifiable security information, such as encryption keys or bootloader status, preventing unauthorized unlocking or downgrading of firmware.
        Firmware version control: eFuses can prevent firmware downgrade attacks. By burning specific eFuse bits, a device can enforce running the latest firmware version, avoiding vulnerable older versions.
        Hardware uniqueness: Some devices use eFuses to generate and store a unique hardware identifier, ensuring that each device has a distinct identity.
